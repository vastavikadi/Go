Memeory management in Golang happens automatically. Memory allocations and deallocations are done automatically.


There are two methods for memory allocation:

new()
- allocate memory but no initialisation
- you will get a memory address
- zeroed storage ( cannot put any data initially)

make()
- allocate memory with initialisation
- you will get a memory address
- non zeroed storage

Garbage collection happens automatically. Condition: - (out of scope or nil)
So there is a threshold value that we can set when that hits garbage collection happens
